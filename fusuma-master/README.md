è¥–(Fusuma) means sliding door used to partition off rooms in a Japanese house.

## Installation

IMPORTANT: You must be a member of the _input_ group to have permission
 to read the touchpad device:

    $ sudo gpasswd -a $USER input

You must log out and back in or restart to assign this group.

You need libinput release 1.0 or later. Install libinput-tools: 

    $ sudo apt-get install libinput-tools

For sending shortcuts:

    $ sudo apt-get install xdotool

Install Fusuma:

    $ gem install fusuma

### Touchpad not working in GNOME

Ensure the touchpad events are being sent to the GNOME desktop by running the following command:

    $ gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.peripherals.touchpad send-events enabled

## Usage

    $ fusuma

## Update

    $ gem update fusuma

## Customize

You can customize the settings for gestures to put and edit `~/.config/fusuma/config.yml`.  
*NOTE*: You will need to create the `~/.config/fusuma` directory if it doesn't exist yet.


### Sample (default keymap for Elementary OS)

```yaml
swipe:
  3: 
    left: 
      shortcut: 'alt+Left'
    right: 
      shortcut: 'alt+Right'
    up: 
      shortcut: 'ctrl+t'
    down: 
      shortcut: 'ctrl+w'
  4:
    left: 
      shortcut: 'super+Left'
    right: 
      shortcut: 'super+Right'
    up: 
      shortcut: 'super+a'
    down: 
      shortcut: 'super+s'
pinch:
  in:
    shortcut: 'ctrl+plus'
  out:
     shortcut: 'ctrl+minus'

threshold:
  swipe: 1
  pinch: 1

interval:
  swipe: 1
  pinch: 1
```

if `shortcut: ` is blank, the swipe/pinch doesn't trigger a keyevent.

`threshold:` is sensitivity to swipe/pinch. Default value is 1.
If the swipe's threshold is `0.5`, shorten swipe-length by half.

`interval:` is delay between swipes/pinches. Default value is 1.
If the swipe's interval is `0.5`, shorten swipe-interval by half to recognize a next swipe.

## Options

*   `-v`, `--verbose`             : Shows details about the results of running fusuma
*   `-c`, `--config=path/to/file` : Use an alternative config file
